### 1 Preface

This is one of the three main **GAP** books. It describes most essential
changes from previous **GAP** releases.

In addition to this manual, there is the ***GAP** Tutorial* (see
[Tutorial: Preface](../../doc/tut/chap1.html#X874E1D45845007FE)) and the
***GAP** Reference Manual* (see Reference: Preface) containing detailed
documentation of the mathematical functionality of **GAP**.

A lot of the functionality of the system and a number of contributed
extensions are provided as **GAP** packages, and each of these has its
own manual. New versions of packages are released independently of
**GAP** releases, and changes between package versions may be described
in their documentation.
